CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /Users/rmarni/Desktop/alex_lem/cmake-build-debug/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /Users/rmarni/Desktop/gleb_alex/cmake-build-debug where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/Users/rmarni/Desktop/alex_lem/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/Users/rmarni/Desktop/gleb_alex/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
